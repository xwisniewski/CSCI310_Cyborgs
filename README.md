⚠️ Firebase Configuration Required

This project uses Firebase services.
Before building the app, you must download your own google-services.json file from the Firebase Console.

Setup Steps:

Go to your Firebase project → ⚙️ Project settings → Your apps.

Download the google-services.json file for the Android app (com.example.csci310_teamproj).

Place it in the folder:

app/google-services.json


(Optional) Use the provided app/google-services.json.example file as a template for reference.

Note: The real google-services.json is ignored by Git for security reasons and must be added locally by each developer.
